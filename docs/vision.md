# Vision: mai-canvas

## What is mai-canvas?

mai-canvas is an open-source, modular dashboard that empowers individuals to orchestrate their digital lives with privacy, transparency, and control.  
It’s a visual “workbench” where you can connect your personal content (files, notes, photos, calendar, etc.) to local and external AI services, automate workflows, and always see what’s happening with your data.

## Why mai-canvas?

- **AI is everywhere, but user control is rare.** Most AI tools and automations are black boxes, sending your data to the cloud with little transparency or choice.
- **Privacy matters.** Sensitive information should stay on your device unless you explicitly allow it to leave.
- **Composability is the future.** The best digital experiences come from mixing and matching the right tools for your needs, not being locked into a single ecosystem.
- **Visual thinking is powerful.** A canvas interface makes complex workflows and data flows intuitive and accessible to everyone.

## Core Principles

- **Privacy by Design:**  
  Your data stays local by default. The “yellow border” on the canvas makes it instantly clear what’s private and what’s external.  
  You control every data flow—nothing leaves your device unless you say so.

- **Modularity & Extensibility:**  
  Everything is a block: local assets, AI models, external services, and abstraction layers.  
  You can add, remove, and connect blocks however you like. Developers can create new plugins and services.

- **Transparency:**  
  Visual “wires” show exactly how your data moves and which services are involved.  
  You can inspect, audit, and control every connection.

- **Composable AI:**  
  Chain together multiple models and services—local or external—for richer, more reliable, and multi-perspective results.  
  Use abstraction (like vector embeddings) to get the benefits of external compute without exposing your raw content.

## What Can You Do With mai-canvas?

- Summarize, search, or analyze your notes and files using local or cloud AI—always knowing where your data goes.
- Automate workflows: e.g., “When I add a new photo, run it through a local classifier, then (optionally) send the result to an external service for tagging.”
- Build consensus: Run the same input through multiple AI models and compare results for accuracy and bias.
- Use privacy-preserving abstraction: Send only vectorized representations of your data to external services for clustering, recommendations, or search—never the raw content.
- Experiment and learn: See how different tools and models interact, and build your own custom digital assistant.

## The mai-canvas Difference

- **Yellow Border:** Instantly see the privacy boundary—what’s local, what’s external.
- **Wiring:** Drag-and-drop connections make data flow and automation visual and intuitive.
- **Abstraction Services:** Use code numbers (vectors) to do useful work without revealing your content.
- **Multi-Agent Chaining:** Get multi-perspective, verified answers by combining different AI agents and services.
- **User Empowerment:** You’re always in control—no black boxes, no surprises.
