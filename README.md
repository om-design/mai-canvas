# mai-canvas
**A personal modular dashboard linking personal content and AI services**


---

## Vision

Personal AI Canvas is an open-source platform that empowers you to orchestrate your digital life with total control and privacy.  
Drag, drop, and wire together your local assets, AI models, and external services on a visual canvas—always knowing what stays private and what leaves your device.

- **Yellow Border:** Instantly see which data and services are local (inside the border) and which are external (outside).
- **Wiring:** Connect your files, notes, and other assets to AI tools and services with intuitive visual “wires.”
- **Privacy by Design:** Data only leaves your device when you explicitly allow it. Vector abstraction services let you use powerful AI without exposing your content.
- **Composable:** Mix and match local and external models, automate workflows, and chain together multiple agents for consensus or verification.
- **Extensible:** Add new services, plugins, and connection types as the ecosystem grows.

## Why?

- **User Control:** You decide what happens with your data, every step of the way.
- **Privacy:** Keep sensitive information local, use abstraction for safe external processing.
- **Modularity:** Build your own workflows, combine the best tools, and adapt as AI evolves.
- **Transparency:** Visualize data flow and service connections at a glance.

---

## How It Works

- **Canvas UI:** Drag-and-drop interface with a yellow border marking your private zone.
- **Blocks:** Represent local assets, AI models, and external services as modular blocks.
- **Wires:** Connect blocks to create workflows. Wires crossing the yellow border indicate data leaving your device.
- **Abstraction Services:** Use vector embeddings to perform useful work (search, clustering, recommendations) without sharing raw content.
- **Multi-Agent Chaining:** Run tasks through multiple models or services for richer, more reliable results.

## Get Involved

We’re looking for:
- Developers (frontend, backend, AI, privacy)
- Designers (UI/UX, workflow visualization)
- Privacy and security experts
- Early adopters and testers
