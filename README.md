# mai-canvas

A personal modular dashboard linking personal content and AI services

---

## Vision

**mai-canvas** is an open-source platform that puts you in control of your digital life.  
Visually connect your files, notes, and personal assets to local and external AI services on a modular canvas—always knowing what stays private and what leaves your device.

- **Yellow Border:** Instantly see which data and services are local (inside the border) and which are external (outside).
- **Wiring:** Drag and drop connections between your content and AI tools, with clear visual cues for privacy and data flow.
- **Privacy by Design:** Data only leaves your device when you explicitly allow it. Use vector abstraction to leverage powerful AI without exposing your raw content.
- **Composable:** Mix and match local and external models, automate workflows, and chain together multiple agents for richer, more reliable results.
- **Extensible:** Add new services, plugins, and connection types as the ecosystem grows.

## Why?

- **User Control:** You decide what happens with your data, every step of the way.
- **Privacy:** Keep sensitive information local, use abstraction for safe external processing.
- **Modularity:** Build your own workflows, combine the best tools, and adapt as AI evolves.
- **Transparency:** Visualize data flow and service connections at a glance.

---

## How It Works

- **Canvas UI:** Drag-and-drop interface with a yellow border marking your private zone.
- **Blocks:** Represent local assets, AI models, and external services as modular blocks.
- **Wires:** Connect blocks to create workflows. Wires crossing the yellow border indicate data leaving your device.
- **Abstraction Services:** Use vector embeddings to perform useful work (search, clustering, recommendations) without sharing raw content.
- **Multi-Agent Chaining:** Run tasks through multiple models or services for consensus, verification, or multi-perspective results.

## Get Involved

We’re looking for:
- Developers (frontend, backend, AI, privacy)
- Designers (UI/UX, workflow visualization)
- Privacy and security experts
- Early adopters and testers

**Join us to build the future of personal AI!**
